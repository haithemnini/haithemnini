As a skilled software developer, I have over three years of experience in Delphi programming and managing MySQL Server. My passion lies in crafting top-notch desktop applications and improving user satisfaction through continuous refinement. I'm also highly driven to work on personal projects, and enjoy staying updated on the latest developments in the developer community.
